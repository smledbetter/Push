<div><b>Rule 4: Give useful, informational feedback.</b></div>


<div>Offer sincere, positive feedback that acknowledges effort, and
non-judgemental advice about any problems.</div>


<div>
<b>Example:</b> “Hey [Name], you’ve successfully logged 3 meals
in a row!”</div>


<div>
<b>Limits:</b> It’s better to understate positive feedback a little
bit than to over do it. Avoid being a cheerleader.</div>

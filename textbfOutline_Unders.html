</div><div>Imagine you’re a product manager at MyFitnessPal. You’ve been asked to
improve the push notification experience. You want to understand what
motivates your users, so you interview a few and ask them why they
respond to push notifications from the MyFitnessPal app. What are their
reasons for opening push notifications? With the help of some
qualitative research jiu-jitsu, you condense their responses and
discover there are six overall categories of reasons. Six types of
“whys”.</div><div>


</div><div>Congratulations! You just recreated what we know from 486 studies
featuring over 205,000 participants: there are six discrete types of
motivation, each contributing to differing outcomes for persistence and
quality of engagement. The differentiator between them is percevied
autonomy and they fall along a continuum (Howard, Gagné, &amp; Bureau,
2017). Ain’t science fun?</div>

This was not a made up story. This is an actual screenshot and the
actual reaction of an actual MyFitnessPal user just before they deleted

Pretty excited to check it out? Were you pretty motivated to start using it, while also skeptical that this might be a waste of your time?&nbsp; Hopeful...but skeptical?

Just like the person using MyFitnessPal in this example was already motivated and feeling good about their experience. But their motivation was fragile enough that one push notification crushed it.&nbsp; People who've signed up for push notifications are hopeful. They are already motivated and&nbsp;<i>want</i> to be supported. But like a new sprout or a baby lamb, that motivation is delicate.</h3>

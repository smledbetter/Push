<div><b>Outline: Push notifications are pushy</b></div><div>


</div><div>One of the great, promising features of the mobile platform was push
notifications. In a world where almost all communication has to be
“retrieved”, push notifications are a direct route to a moment of
someone’s attention. Done well, they have the potential to be one of the
most important interactions that an app can have with the people using
it. Unfortunately, they’re so often abused that more and more people are
just turning them off. As summarized by @scottbelsky:</div><div>


</div><blockquote><div>When they first came out, app developers rejoiced at the prospects of
engaging their users outside of the app, anytime they wanted to. But we
were left with a noisy, random, and border-line abusive user experience
where notifications have become a tactic to steal our attention rather
than enhance our lives. The fact that notifications are an unsustainable
“hack” is becoming increasingly clear.

</div><div>Mr. Belsky chalks this up to a
<i>tragedy
of the commons</i>, but we disagree with that assessment (the ambient home
screen, notifications, and out-of-app state of your device are not a
shared and unregulated resource like the communal grazing fields that
William Forster Lloyd outlined in 1833. Thanks to iOS and Android,
everyone has personal control over who has what kind of access to the
common spaces that app developers share on their device). We think the
real reason people hate push notifications is much simpler to explain:</div>

<div><b>Outline: People don’t care about apps. They want to live a
better life.</b></div>


<div>So now you’re probably thinking, “great! We’ll just push them better
reasons to use the app!”</div>


<div>Well, we’ll save you the time A/B testing “open our app! It’s fun!”
Because telling people how to feel is a surefire way to make them feel
coerced. Do you like it when people tell you to do things because
“it’ll be fun!” or “it’ll make you a better person!?” Of course not,
because it’s not autonomy-supportive at all. It’s pushy.</div>


<div>People don’t commit and truly engage with something because they are
told to. We engage with something when it lets us explore who we could
be if we mastered it. High motivation quality is not a thing we can give
to people, it’s a <i>result</i> of supporting their Basic Psychological
Need for autonomy.</div>


<div>As Kathy Sierra says in <i>Badass: Making Users Awesome:</i>

<blockquote>

<div>Let’s be real: people don’t care about apps. They care about learning
what they need to learn and doing what they need to do in order to live
a better, more meaningful life. An app is a tool that teaches them how
to get there. And in order to better motivate people we have to think
past the tool to the person who we’re asking to wield it.</div>


<div>You’re Obi-Wan; they’re Luke Skywalker; and your app is a lightsaber. A
lightsaber is a tool Jedi use, but turning it on doesn’t make you a
Jedi. When Obi-Wan hands Luke his father’s lightsaber he doesn’t say,
“congrats! You’re a Jedi!” He says, “This was your father’s
lightsaber. This is the weapon of a Jedi Knight. It’s not as clumsy or
random as a blaster. An elegant weapon for a more civilized age.”</div>

<div>Seriously? That’s motivating. And sure, when Luke first gets the
lightsaber from Obi-Wan, Luke is probably thinking, “neat, a laser
sword!” But notice that Obi-Wan doesn’t try to convince Luke to become
a Jedi and defeat the Empire by talking about all the things he could do
with his lightsaber. He doesn’t try to bribe or nudge Luke into going to
lightsabre practice. He connects the tool to identity (Jedi Knight) and
integration (his unknown father). He also implies personality traits
that Luke would have by choosing to master this tool (elegance,
civilized) versus another (clumsy, random). Most importantly, Obi-Wan
connects with Luke’s struggle to learn the ways of the Force with a long
history (the Jedi) and a shared mission (defeating Darth Vader). Obi-Wan
does not tell Luke how to feel. He supports Luke as Luke finds his own
more resilient, self-determined motives. Because when Luke eventually
learns that Darth Vader is a giant black cyborg with James Earl Jones’
voice who Force Chokes the people who piss him off, Luke is probably
gonna need more reasons to stay and fight than “neat, a laser sword!”</div>


<div>Likewise, when we design push notifications, our job is not to push
people into engaging with our product. It’s to guide people along the
journey of learning <i>their own</i> self-determined reasons for using
the app and help them become more resilient to setbacks and
disappointment. To move past, “I’m using this app because I feel like I
have to” and start feeling like “I’m using this app get personally
important outcomes” or “I’m using this app because it’s an expression
of who I am.” Self-Determination Theory calls this process of learning
and endorsing new motivates, “integration.” And while integrating new
behaviors and tools into your personal identity is not fast or easy, the
conditions that make that process possible have been well established by
research. And Jedi Masters.</div>

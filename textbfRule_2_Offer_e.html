<div><b> Offer empathetic rationales.</b></div><div>


</div><div>An empathetic rationale explains to the user why they should do a thing,
given their goals. It explains why any request from the app is
personally relevant to them.</div><div>


</div><div>
<b>Example:</b> “Hey [Name], last time we spoke you mentioned you
wanted to track your body weight, this week. Here’s your friendly
reminder!”</div><div>


</div><div>
<b><b>Limit(s)</b>:</b> A limit of this technique is that you have to do the
hard work of helping users figure out what they actually want. They
might not know what they want, or they might change their mind. But it
still on you as the app designer to facilitate that process and to check
in regularly to make sure they still want it.</div><div></div><div><b>Reference(s):</b></div><div></div><div>Steingut, R. R., Patall, E. A., &amp; Trimble, S. S. (2017).

of MyFitnessPal in the long-run when they aim for about 0.5 to 1.0 pound
of weight loss every week.”</div><div>

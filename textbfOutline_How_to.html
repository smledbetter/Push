<h2 data-label="675608" class="ltx_title_subsection">What Integration Looks Like</h2><div>


According to Self-Determination Theory, people learn to value new
behaviors, such as using an app, when doing those behaviors promotes the
satisfaction of the three basic psychological needs of autonomy,
competence, and relatedness. Autonomy, as we already mentioned, is
satisfied when people feel like they have choice and ownership over
their behavior. The opposite of autonomy is feeling coerced. Competence
is satisfied when people feel like they can successfully meet the
demands of an activity. The opposite of competence is feeling
ineffective or impotent. Relatedness is satisfied when the people you
care about also care about you. The opposite of relatedness is feeling
disconnected and isolated.</div><div>


</div><div>When you support the satisfaction of autonomy, competence, and
relatedness, people will start to find using your app motivating for
more self-determined reasons. They’ll start to integrate those motives
and as they do they’ll actually start to integrate your product into
their sense of self. They’ll find using the app as exciting and
important as you do. They’ll be proactive about getting better. They’ll
tell all their friends and family about it. And using your app will
become an expression of who they are, because it will be helping them
live the better life they wanted.</div>

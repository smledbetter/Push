<div><i>Most push notifications are pushy.</i></div><div>


</div><div>So why are push notifications perceived as pushy…and how can we make
them motivating instead?</div><div>


</div><h2 data-label="avoiding-the-dark-side" class="ltx_title_subsection">Avoiding the Dark Side</h2><div>


</div><div>How did you feel the last time you downloaded an app? Pretty excited to
check it out? Were you pretty motivated to start using it, while also skeptical that this might be a waste of your time?&nbsp; Hopeful...but skeptical? That fragile motivation is super common. That motivation is so fragile in fact, that 62% of apps are used less than 11 times and&nbsp;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/05/31/nearly-1-in-4-people-abandon-mobile-apps-after-only-one-use/" target="_blank">25% of apps are abandoned after people use them just once</a>.  Similarly, the person using MyFitnessPal in this example was already motivated and feeling good about their experience. But their motivation was fragile enough that one push notification crushed it.&nbsp; And this is something important
to remember:</div><div>


</div><div>People who've signed up for push notifications are hopeful. They are already motivated and&nbsp;<i>want</i> to be supported. But at first, that motivation is fragile.</div><div></div><div>Habitry has watched thousands of people interact with
hundreds of Behavior Change Techniques. We’ve seen over and over again
that most people will never be as motivated to change as they are on the
first day of the intervention. And a major portion of users stop using
interventions before they achieve their personal goals <i>even when
the technique is working</i>. Eysenbach (2005) calls this The Law of
Attrition. Users show up motivated but leave feeling demotivated.</div><div></div><div>


</div><div>As Motivation Designers, we can do better. The first step is to
recognize when you fall into <i>The Motivator Trap</i> , which is the
misguided belief that Motivation Designers are responsible for
motivating users. To “make” them motivated. But this like a farmer
saying they “make” corn. A farmer doesn’t make corn, a farmer grows
corn. They plant seeds then give the seeds what they need to do what
seeds do. If a farmer thinks they “make” corn, then they’re going to
make a lot of mistakes when the corn fails to materialize in the field.
Likewise, it’s important to remember that motivation is an emotion that
<a href="https://medium.com/practical-motivation-science/motivating-humans-cbf9494eddf1" target="_blank">grows when people are in the right conditions</a> and get what they need.</div><div>


</div><div>People are already motivated, and our job as Motivation Designers is
give people what they need to stay that way and to avoid doing things
that actively de-motivate them. People want to endorse and fall in love
with our products and content, but on their own terms. Yet, we
Motivation Designers tend to ignore that human beings are active
organisms striving to experience our behavior as autonomous. As
@antoinesakho puts it:</div><div>


</div><blockquote><div>An experience so good it doesn’t even feel like a re-engagement
campaign, but as a genuinely valuable feature.


</div></blockquote><div>We titled this publication, <i>Practical Motivation Science</i> , so it
might shock you when we take radical position that it is NOT our jobs to
motivate people. Rather, we believe Motivation Designers are responsible
for creating spaces where users feel free to motivate themselves.</div><div>

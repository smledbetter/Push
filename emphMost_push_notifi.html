Quit</h2><div>Imagine you’re a product manager at MyFitnessPal. You’ve been asked to
improve the push notification experience. You want to understand what
motivates your users, so you interview a few and ask them why they
respond to push notifications from the MyFitnessPal app. What are their
reasons for opening push notifications? With the help of some
qualitative research jiu-jitsu, you condense their responses and
discover there are six overall categories of reasons. Six types of
“whys”.</div><div>


</div><div>Congratulations! You just recreated what we know from 486 studies
featuring over 205,000 participants: there are six discrete types of
motivation, each contributing to differing outcomes for persistence and
quality of engagement. That's right, motivation doesn't just vary by amount. There's another variable that matters even more for long-term pThe differentiator between them is perceived
autonomy and they fall along a continuum (Howard, Gagné, &amp; Bureau,
2017). Ain’t science fun?</div>

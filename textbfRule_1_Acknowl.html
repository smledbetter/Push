<div><b>Request, don't demand.</b></div><div>Most push notifications either demand or inform (then sometimes demand). Since one of the most important components of autonomy is choice, how these demands come across to the people receiving them really matters. In our experience, the main reason push notifications usually demotivate people is because they are make demands with little regard for how those demands will make people feel. There's nothing wrong with asking people to do stuff, but how demotivating a task feels all comes down to the way that the task is presented. Is it a demand, or a request?</div><div></div><div>"Would you mind getting me a cup of coffee?" feels a lot nicer than, "Get me a cup of coffee" because the former example implies autonomy, the latter does not. It's also more motivating</div><div></div><div><b>Example:&nbsp;</b></div><div></div><div><b>Limits:</b></div><div></div><div><b>Reference:</b></div><div></div><div><b>Acknowledge and normalize negative emotions. </b></div><div>


</div><div>To be fair to the MyFitnessPal team, the push notification above is not
bad. It’s polite-ish. But obviously, the user above didn’t think so.</div><div>


</div><div>A better strategy is to be real with users. Weigh loss takes years. It's a long,
hard, and confusing process. You can help users protect their motivation
by hinting that they might feel annoyed, angry, or frustrated on that journey. This rule
supports autonomy because it takes the pressure off of users to be
pollyanna. It communicates to users that it’s okay if they feel any
negative emotions. And because of this, they are more likely to maintain
their motivation over the long run. It also takes the pressure off of
app designers to act like cheerleaders all the time.</div><div>

<b>Example:</b> “Hey [Name], we don’t mean to be a Nagging Ned –
would you like to update your body weight today? It’s totally cool if
you might not feel like it today.”</div><div>


</div><div>
<b>Limits:</b> This rule won’t work if you <i>tell</i> them how they
should feel. Note we didn’t say “you will definitely get annoyed”. We
simply suggested it’s possible. We gave them space to decide how they
feel. Telling the user how they will feel is subtly coercive. So it pays
to use tentative language.</div>

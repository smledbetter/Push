<div>You can think of it like a road trip: If the journey is short, it
doesn’t matter what car you pick. You can make it from London to Essex
in a 3-wheeled Robin Reliant. As long as you don’t expect much, have any
passengers, or turn frequently, the 3-wheeled Robin will probably get
you there without rolling over and killing you too often. But if you
absolutely need to get you and your family from Point A to Point B,
you’re going to want a Land Rover.</div>


<div>Similarly, when people only have lower quality, non-self-determined
reasons, motivation will just be less reliable. You’re more likely to
interpret setbacks as personal shortcomings. You blame yourself for your
lack of progress when MyFitnessPal asks you to report your body weight.
You see this whole “fitness thing” like a waste of time. Without the
resilience of more self-determined reasons, we try less hard and we quit
sooner.</div>

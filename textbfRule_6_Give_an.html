<div><b>Rule 6: Give an unexpected and personal compliment.</b></div>


<div>Unexpected compliments are a great way to foster a sense of connection
with users.</div>


<div>
<b>Example:</b> “We’ve been working together for 3 weeks now. We’ve
really enjoyed our time together so far…”</div>


<div>
<b>Limits:</b> If you over do this, it can become <i>expected</i> ,
which will feel controlling. Also, try to make this as personal as
possible. If you can give the same compliment to all your users, it’s
probably not personal.</div>

</tbody></table></div><div></div><div>As you see on the list, some types of motivation feel more
“self-determined”—like their our own idea—and some feel less
self-determined—like other people are making us do it. And it’s pretty
obvious that “I open push notifications because it’s fun,” feels way
more voluntary than, “I open push notifications because the app makes
me.” How self-determined it feels to use an app is the difference
between <i>wanting</i> to use an app and <i>having</i> to use an app.
And the longer we need or expect people to use an app, the more this
perception matters. Because while these differences might not show up in
app usage rates <i>at first</i> (guilt is a powerful motivator), from 40
years of
<i>Self-Determination
Theory</i> research we know that—over time—the differences in the
reasons why people are doing something is the most important factor for
<i>how well</i> people do it, as well as <i>how much.</i>
</div><div></div><blockquote><div>Self-determined reasons are what make motivation more resilient.</div></blockquote><div>
</div><div>The variable that creates these six different motivation types is
<i>perceived autonomy</i> . Notice that some of these motives generate
strong feelings of autonomy (“this is who I am”), and some come with
strong feelings of pressure (“someone else is making me”). That’s
because autonomy is that feeling you get when you act with a sense of
choice, initiative, volition, and meaning. It’s the need to experience
our actions as our own. To stand by them. This is the feeling you get
when you “give a damn” about something; when you feel like what you’re
doing matters. The opposite of autonomy is feeling coerced or
manipulated. Like you’re being forced to do stuff that you personally
don’t give a damn about. When life feels like a dull routine, when you
feel pushed and nudged from all directions, when you feel like what you
want doesn’t matter, then your sense of autonomy has been frustrated.
And the easiest way to get back a feeling of autonomy is to quit.</div><div>


</div><div>When people download an app—especially an app designed to help people
with something as emotionally charged as weight loss—they usually feel
very motivated to change. At Habitry we say, “they’re comin’ in hot.”
They’re sick of where they currently are—Point A—and where they want
to go—Point B—can’t come fast enough. They just want the app to tell
them the things they need to do to get the outcomes they want. If you
interview them and ask them why they want to get to Point B, you might
you might learn they feel pressured to change by people or society at
large. Their doctor told them they need to lose 15 pounds. Or they want
to get ready for their wedding and fit into a tux or dress. Or they want
to make their ex jealous. Whatever their goal, they want to get away
from Point A (reality) and get to Point B (utopia) as fast as possible.</div><div>


</div><div>Take a second and imagine how these reasons feel from their perspective.
These are all reasons that sound like they could be categorized as
”non-self determined”. In Self-Determination Theory, these are
“external” and “introjected” motivations which are lower quality
compared to identified, integrated, and intrinsic motivations. In the
short run, this difference in quality doesn’t matter too much. You’ll
see lots of engagement and usage. But in 2-3 weeks, the difference in
people’s “whys” will start to show up as things start to go wrong, or
just not as fast as the people trying to get to Point B want them too.</div><div>


</div><div>Non-self-determined motives are just more fragile than self-determined
ones. That might not matter if you only need people to use your product
for two weeks. But if you want people to use your product for longer
than that, or you want people to actually <i>love</i> your product and
tell their friends about it, motivation quality will matter more and
more. And for product that helps people with weightloss—like
MyFitnessPal—the journey from Point A to Point B might take</div>

</tbody></table></div><div></div><div>As you see on the list, some types of motivation feel more
“self-determined”—like their our own idea—and some feel less
self-determined—like other people are making us do it. And it’s pretty
obvious that “I open push notifications because it’s fun,” feels way
more voluntary than, “I open push notifications because the app makes
me.” How self-determined it feels to use an app is the difference
between&nbsp;<i>wanting</i> to use an app and&nbsp;<i>having</i> to use an app.
And the longer we need or expect people to use an app, the more this
perception matters. That's right, motivation doesn't just vary by amount. It also varies in quality. And from 40
years of
<i>Self-Determination
Theory</i> research we know that—over time—the differences in the
reasons why people are doing something—motivation quality—is the most important factor for
<i>how well</i> people do it, as well as&nbsp;<i>how much.</i>
</div><div></div><blockquote><div>More self-determined reasons are what make motivation more resilient.</div></blockquote><div>
The variable that creates these six different motivation types more or less self-determined is
<i>perceived autonomy</i> . Notice that some of these motives generate
strong feelings of autonomy (“this is who I am”), and some come with
strong feelings of pressure (“someone else is making me”). That’s
because autonomy is that feeling you get when you act with a sense of
choice, initiative, volition, and meaning. It’s the need to experience
our actions as our own. To stand by them. This is the feeling you get
when you “give a damn” about something; when you feel like what you’re
doing matters. The opposite of autonomy is feeling coerced or
manipulated. Like you’re being forced to do stuff that you personally
don’t give a damn about. When life feels like a dull routine, when you
feel pushed and nudged from all directions, when you feel like what you
want doesn’t matter, then your sense of autonomy has been frustrated.
And the easiest way to get back a feeling of autonomy is to quit doing the thing that's making you feel icky.</div><div>
</div><div>Take a second and imagine how someone downloading MyFitnessPal might feel.&nbsp;You're sick of where they currently are—Point A—and where you want to go—Point B—can’t come fast enough. You just want the app to tell them the things they need to do to get the outcomes they want. You  might  feel pressured to change by people or society at large. Your doctor might have told you that you need to lose 15 pounds.  Or you might want to make your ex jealous. And you definitely want to get away from Point A (reality) and get to Point B (utopia) as fast as possible.</div><div></div><div>All these reasons sound like they could be categorized as
”non-self determined,” and they are definitely where most people on a weight loss journey start out (Silva et al. 2010). These 
“external” and “introjected” motivations  are lower quality
compared to "identified," "integrated," and "intrinsic" motivations because they contribute to an external locus of control and a feeling of being "controlled" or "coerced." In the
short run, this might not matter too much. You’ll
see lots of engagement and usage. But in 2-3 weeks, the difference in
people’s “whys” will start to impact their persistence as things start to get hard or results don't come as fast as people want them to.</div><div>


</div><div>Delicate motivatemight not matter if you only need people to use your product
for two weeks. But if you want people to use your product for longer
than that, or you want people to actually&nbsp;<i>love</i> your product and
tell their friends about it, motivation quality will matter more and
more. And for a product that helps people with weight loss—like
MyFitnessPal—the journey from Point A to Point B might take&nbsp;<i>years.</i></div><div>


</div><div>You can think of it like a road trip: If the journey is short, it
doesn’t matter what car you pick. You can make it from London to Essex
in a 3-wheeled Robin Reliant. As long as you don’t expect much, have any
passengers, or turn frequently, the 3-wheeled Robin will probably get
you there without rolling over and killing you too often. But if you
absolutely need to get you and your family from Point A to Point B,
you’re going to want a Land Rover.</div><div>


</div><div>Similarly, when people only have lower quality, non-self-determined
reasons, motivation will just be less reliable. You’re more likely to
interpret setbacks as personal shortcomings. You blame yourself for your
lack of progress when MyFitnessPal asks you to report your body weight.
You see this whole “fitness thing” like a waste of time. Without the
resilience of more self-determined reasons, we try less hard and we quit
sooner.</div><div>


</div><h2 data-label="the-psychology-of-why-users-commit" class="ltx_title_subsection">The Psychology of Why Users Commit




</h2><div>So now you’re probably thinking, “great! We’ll just push them better
reasons to use the app!”</div><div>


</div><div>Well, we’ll save you the time A/B testing “open our app! It’s fun!”
Because telling people how to feel is  a surefire way to make them feel
coerced. Do you like it when people tell you to do things because
“it’ll be fun!” or “it’ll make you a better person!?” Of course not,
because it’s not autonomy-supportive at all. It’s pushy.</div><div>


</div><div>People don’t commit and truly engage with something because they are
told to. We engage with something when it lets us explore who we could
be if we mastered it. High motivation quality is not a thing we can give
to people, it’s a <i>result</i> of supporting their Basic Psychological
Need for autonomy.</div><div>


</div><div>As Kathy Sierra says in <i>Badass: Making Users Awesome:</i>
</div><div>


</div><blockquote><div>
</div><div><div>They don’t say they like the product because they like the product.

</div><div>
They say they like the product because they like themselves.


</div></div><div>
</div></blockquote><div>


</div><div>Let’s be real: people don’t care about apps. They care about learning
what they need to learn and doing what they need to do in order to live
a better, more meaningful life. An app is a tool that teaches them how
to get there. And in order to better motivate people we have to think
past the tool to the person who we’re asking to wield it.</div><div>


</div><div>You’re Obi-Wan; they’re Luke Skywalker; and your app is a lightsaber. A
lightsaber is a tool Jedi use, but turning it on doesn’t make you a
Jedi. When Obi-Wan hands Luke his father’s lightsaber he doesn’t say,
“congrats! You’re a Jedi!” He says, “This was your father’s
lightsaber. This is the weapon of a Jedi Knight. It’s not as clumsy or
random as a blaster. An elegant weapon for a more civilized age.”</div><div>


</div><div>https://youtu.be/hFB16GCocfw</div><div>


</div><div>Seriously? That’s motivating. And sure, when Luke first gets the
lightsaber from Obi-Wan, Luke is probably thinking, “neat, a laser
sword!” But notice that Obi-Wan doesn’t try to convince Luke to become
a Jedi and defeat the Empire by talking about all the things he could do
with his lightsaber. He doesn’t try to bribe or nudge Luke into going to
lightsabre practice. He connects the tool to identity (Jedi Knight) and
integration (his unknown father). He also implies personality traits
that Luke would have by choosing to master this tool (elegance,
civilized) versus another (clumsy, random). Most importantly, Obi-Wan
connects with Luke’s struggle to learn the ways of the Force with a long
history (the Jedi) and a shared mission (defeating Darth Vader). Obi-Wan
does not tell Luke how to feel. He supports Luke as Luke finds his own
more resilient, self-determined motives. Because when Luke eventually
learns that Darth Vader is a giant black cyborg with James Earl Jones’
voice who Force Chokes the people who piss him off, Luke is probably
gonna need more reasons to stay and fight than “neat, a laser sword!”</div><div>


</div><div>Likewise, when we design push notifications, our job is not to push
people into engaging with our product. It’s to guide people along the
journey of learning <i>their own</i> self-determined reasons for using
the app and help them become more resilient to setbacks and
disappointment. To move past, “I’m using this app because I feel like I
have to” and start feeling like “I’m using this app get personally
important outcomes” or “I’m using this app because it’s an expression
of who I am.” Self-Determination Theory calls this process of learning
and endorsing new motivates, “integration.” And while integrating new
behaviors and tools into your personal identity is not fast or easy, the
conditions that make that process possible have been well established by
research. And Jedi Masters.</div>

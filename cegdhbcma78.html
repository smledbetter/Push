</div><div>To be fair to the MyFitnessPal team, the push notification above is not
bad. It’s polite-ish. But obviously, the user above didn’t think so.</div><div>


</div><div>A better strategy is to be real with users. Weigh loss takes years. It's a long,
hard, and confusing process. You can help users protect their motivation
by hinting that they might feel annoyed, angry, or frustrated on that journey. This rule
supports autonomy because it takes the pressure off of users to be
pollyanna. It communicates to users that it’s okay if they feel any
negative emotions. And because of this, they are more likely to maintain
their motivation over the long run. It also takes the pressure off of
app designers to act like cheerleaders all the time.</div><div>

<b>Example:</b> “Hey [Name], we don’t mean to be a Nagging Ned –
would you like to update your body weight today? It’s totally cool if
you might not feel like it today.”</div><div>

<b>Limits:</b> This rule won’t work if you <i>tell</i> them how they
should feel. Note we didn’t say “you will definitely get annoyed”. We
simply suggested it’s possible. We gave them space to decide how they
feel. Telling the user how they will feel is subtly coercive. So it pays
to use tentative language.</div><div></div><div><b>References:&nbsp;</b>  	 		 		 	</div>
